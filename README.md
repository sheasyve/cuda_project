#### There is a c++ version and a CUDA version in respective folders.
- *CUDA application*
Build with cmake.
- *C++ application*
Build with docker.
- **Main Branch (`main`)**:  
  Don’t commit directly to `main` to save your work unless it's a small, safe change.
  
- **Feature Branches**:  
  Create a new branch for any bigger changes or experiments. 
  - Branch naming can be simple, like `feature/your-name` or `fix/small-change`.

- **Avoid Overlap**:  
  Let everyone know what you’re working on to avoid two people doing the same thing. Just a quick message or note is enough.
