# cuda_project
#### For now, a basic c++ implementation has been started in the cppapplication folder.
#### Installing this with docker should be somewhat simple for any operating system, so we dont need to use colab just yet.

- **Keep Docker in Mind**:  
  Make sure changes work with our Docker setup so things remain easy for everyone, regardless of the OS.
  
- **Main Branch (`main`)**:  
  Don’t commit directly to `main` to save your work unless it's a small, safe change.
  
- **Feature Branches**:  
  Create a new branch for any bigger changes or experiments. 
  - Branch naming can be simple, like `feature/your-name` or `fix/small-change`.

- **Avoid Overlap**:  
  Let everyone know what you’re working on to avoid two people doing the same thing. Just a quick message or note is enough.
